# Covid-19-detection-using-Machine-Learning
Technological advancements significantly impact all aspects of life, including the medical field, where artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role. AI systems analyze and process vast amounts of data to make informed decisions, which is vital for the early diagnosis and prevention of life-threatening diseases. COVID-19, a highly contagious virus, quickly became a global pandemic requiring urgent attention. The rapid spread of the virus underscores the need for effective detection systems. Abundant COVID-19 data available through technological advancements can be leveraged to extract critical information about the virus. This project evaluates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in detecting COVID-19, aiming to employ the most accurate algorithm in the final model.
The novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by the end of that month. Recognizing the global threat, the virus was officially named COVID-19 by WHO on February 11, 2020, which subsequently declared the outbreak a public health emergency. The virus transmits via the respiratory tract, typically manifesting symptoms within 2-14 days in an infected individual. Symptoms range from moderate, such as dry cough and fatigue, to severe, including dyspnea and high fever, especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. The dire consequences of the rapid viral spread, which has resulted in significant mortality, highlight the urgency for a reliable detection system. This project focuses on comparing machine learning algorithms like K-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes based on their accuracy to develop an effective predictive model for COVID-19 detection using available data.
